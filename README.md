## Credits

The Budget Tracker was created using starter code in combination of code written by myself, Sammi Moore. The start code was provided by Xandromus, and can be accessed by clicking on this [GitHub](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/symmetrical-bassoon) link. The starter code contained all of the front-end functionality, as well as the server and some api routes to allow the user to send data from the front-end to the back-end and mongoDB database. My contribution to this code was to make the application functional offline. I added indexedDB and a service worker to store data in the browser and then allow users to track their budgets offline or with poor internet connection respectively. I also added a manifest.json file in order for the app to be converted into a PWA.

The resources that I used for this project are as follows:
- The mongoose package from npm in this node.js application in order more easily use mysql databases (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- The express package from npm to create the server and routes (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- The node.js date-and-time date formatter from npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-and-time)
